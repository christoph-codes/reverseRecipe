## Challenge

If you've been a member of the DEV community for a while, you've likely encountered articles by the talented team over at MongoDB (many members of their team have been using DEV for years).

But while you might be familiar with MongoDB, it's possible that you haven't used their modern database platform for yourself — this hackathon is the perfect opportunity to explore it! MongoDB believes that working with data doesn't need to be hard. In fact, it can be an intuitive experience for all developers.

**For this hackathon, we're offering you the chance to build an application within the guidelines below by utilizing MongoDB Atlas: a collection of cloud database and data services that helps you accelerate and simplify how you use data in your work, including but not limited to:**

- [Atlas Search](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/): Build fast, relevance-based full-text search in your applications in minutes.
- [Atlas Serverless Instances](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-new-serverless-instance/): Deploy a serverless database that can scale on-demand with minimal configuration.
- [Time Series Collections](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/timeseries-collections/): An efficient way to store sequences of measurements over a period of time.
- [Realm Functions](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/functions/): Define and execute JavaScript functions to build APIs, integrate with cloud services, and lots more.
- [Realm Triggers](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/triggers/trigger-types/): Automatically run functions in response to database changes, user events, or preset intervals.

To view documentation for each tool listed, please click on the hyperlinks above.

DEV and MongoDB are challenging you to choose a category (from the list below) and build an application that utilizes Atlas and other MongoDB tools as described within that category.

Once your app is complete and follows all the requirements (see "How to Submit" below), you'll be publishing a post on DEV that describes what you created. That post will serve as your official submission.

We’re excited to see what you build for the MongoDB Atlas Hackathon using MongoDB's ecosystem of tools built for developers, by developers.

## Categories
- **E-Commerce Creation**: Build an e-commerce store using MongoDB Atlas Search.
(Sample use-cases: product catalog, food ordering/delivery service)

- **Prime Time**: Build an application using MongoDB Time Series Collections.
(Sample use cases: IoT, financial analytics, climate observations)

- **Action Star**: Build an event-driven application using MongoDB Realm Functions and Triggers
(Sample use cases: inventory monitoring, logistics apps, alerts/notification apps)

- **Automation Innovation**: Automate a task that you perform on a weekly basis using MongoDB Atlas Serverless Instances.
(Sample use-cases: Payroll/ billing, reporting, scheduling, email responses)

- **Choose Your Own Adventure**: Create an application using MongoDB Atlas that doesn’t fit into any of the categories above.
(Note: the winners we select in this category will be the ones that got super creative and wacky! Feel free to go as random as possible.)

**Sounds like fun, right? The great news is that this hackathon provides you with more than just fun and a chance to learn — all participants with valid submissions will also be entered to win a part of MongoDB's exciting prize package 💰.**
