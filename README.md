# reverseRecipe
A reverse recipe application for the MongoDB Hackathon 2021!

### Overview of My Submission

The purpose of our app is to search our MongoDB database for a list of recipe's based on a list of entered ingredients. We connected our Mongo Realm account with serverless functions and made GraphQL calls to retrieve the data from our database. We plan for a lot more to come and plan to continue working on it post Hackathon. Feel free to check it out!
